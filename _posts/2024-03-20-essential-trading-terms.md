Understanding trading terminology is crucial for anyone entering the financial markets. This comprehensive guide covers the essential terms you'll encounter as a trader, from basic concepts to more advanced terminology. Mastering these terms will help you communicate effectively with other traders and understand market analysis.

## Basic Trading Concepts

### What is a Pip?

A pip (Percentage in Point) is the smallest price move that a given exchange rate can make based on market convention. In most currency pairs, a pip is the fourth decimal place.

**Example:**
- If EUR/USD moves from 1.1050 to 1.1051, that's a 1-pip move
- If GBP/USD moves from 1.2500 to 1.2510, that's a 10-pip move

**Pip Values:**
- **Standard Lot**: $10 per pip (100,000 units)
- **Mini Lot**: $1 per pip (10,000 units)
- **Micro Lot**: $0.10 per pip (1,000 units)

### What is a Lot?

A lot is the standard unit size for forex trades. It represents the amount of currency you're trading.

**Lot Sizes:**
- **Standard Lot**: 100,000 units of base currency
- **Mini Lot**: 10,000 units of base currency
- **Micro Lot**: 1,000 units of base currency
- **Nano Lot**: 100 units of base currency (some brokers)

### Spread and Commission

**Spread:**
The difference between the bid (sell) and ask (buy) price. This is how most forex brokers make money.

A fixed fee charged per trade, typically in addition to or instead of spreads.

### Leverage and Margin
