Chart patterns are powerful tools that help traders identify potential market movements and make informed trading decisions. These patterns, formed by price action over time, provide valuable insights into market psychology and future price direction. This comprehensive guide covers the most important chart patterns and how to trade them effectively.

## Understanding Chart Patterns

### What Are Chart Patterns?

Chart patterns are recognizable formations created by price movements on a chart. They represent the collective psychology of market participants and often indicate potential future price movements.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Visual Formations:** Specific shapes created by price action
- **Psychological Significance:** Reflect market sentiment and behavior
- **Predictive Value:** Often indicate future price movements
- **Time-Based:** Form over specific periods depending on timeframe

### Why Chart Patterns Work

Chart patterns work because they:
1. **Reflect Human Psychology:** Show how traders react to similar situations
2. **Create Self-Fulfilling Prophecies:** When many traders recognize patterns, they act accordingly
3. **Indicate Supply/Demand:** Show areas where buying or selling pressure builds
4. **Provide Risk-Reward:** Offer clear entry, exit, and risk management points

## Continuation Patterns

### Triangles

**Definition:** Patterns where price action narrows into a triangle shape, indicating a temporary pause in the trend before continuation.

#### Ascending Triangle

**Formation:**
- **Upper Line:** Horizontal resistance level
- **Lower Line:** Rising support line (higher lows)
- **Shape:** Triangle pointing upward

**Psychology:**
- Buyers become more aggressive (higher lows)
- Sellers maintain resistance at same level
- Eventually, buyers break through resistance

**Trading Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Break above resistance with volume
- **Stop Loss:** Below the rising support line
- **Target:** Measure the height of the triangle and project upward
- **Confirmation:** Volume should increase on breakout

**Example Setup:**
- EUR/USD forms ascending triangle over 2 weeks
- Resistance at 1.1050, support rising from 1.1000 to 1.1030
- Break above 1.1050 with high volume
- Target: 1.1050 + (1.1050 - 1.1000) = 1.1100

#### Descending Triangle

**Formation:**
- **Upper Line:** Falling resistance line (lower highs)
- **Lower Line:** Horizontal support level
- **Shape:** Triangle pointing downward

**Psychology:**
- Sellers become more aggressive (lower highs)
- Buyers maintain support at same level
- Eventually, sellers break through support

**Trading Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Break below support with volume
- **Stop Loss:** Above the falling resistance line
- **Target:** Measure the height of the triangle and project downward
- **Confirmation:** Volume should increase on breakdown

#### Symmetrical Triangle

**Formation:**
- **Upper Line:** Falling resistance line (lower highs)
- **Lower Line:** Rising support line (higher lows)
- **Shape:** Triangle pointing sideways

**Psychology:**
- Neither buyers nor sellers gaining control
- Market in balance, waiting for breakout
- Direction determined by which side breaks

**Trading Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Break in either direction with volume
- **Stop Loss:** Other side of the triangle
- **Target:** Measure the height and project in breakout direction
- **Confirmation:** Volume and momentum indicators

### Flags and Pennants

#### Bull Flag

**Formation:**
- **Flagpole:** Strong upward move
- **Flag:** Small downward or sideways channel
- **Shape:** Rectangular flag pointing down

- **Target:** Measure flagpole height and project upward
- **Confirmation:** Volume should increase on breakout

#### Bear Flag

**Formation:**
- **Flagpole:** Strong downward move
- **Flag:** Small upward or sideways channel
- **Shape:** Rectangular flag pointing up

**Psychology:**

- **Confirmation:** Volume and momentum

### Wedges

#### Rising Wedge

**Formation:**
- **Upper Line:** Steeply rising resistance
- **Lower Line:** Less steeply rising support
- **Shape:** Wedge pointing upward

**Psychology:**

- Often leads to breakdown

**Trading Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Break below support line
- **Stop Loss:** Above resistance line
- **Target:** Measure wedge height and project downward
- **Confirmation:** Volume increase on breakdown

#### Falling Wedge

**Formation:**

**Rule:** If you have to squint to see it, it's not a pattern

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Volume

**Problem:** Not confirming patterns with volume
**Solution:** Always check volume on breakouts
**Rule:** Volume confirms, lack of volume questions

### Mistake 3: Not Using Stop Losses

**Problem:** Relying on patterns without risk management
**Solution:** Always use stop losses
**Rule:** No pattern is 100% reliable

### Mistake 4: Over-Trading

**Problem:** Trading every pattern you see
**Solution:** Focus on high-probability setups
**Rule:** Quality over quantity

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Market Context

**Problem:** Trading patterns against the trend
**Solution:** Consider overall market direction
**Rule:** Trend trumps patterns
